# Implementing-Integrity-Access-Control-Monitor

In this project, I implemented a reference monitor that enforces various methods for protecting
integrity of data and process using Mandatory Integrity protection systems. More specifically my
implementation accommodates the following: \
- Biba Integrity policy, \
- Windows Mandatory Integrity Control (MIC) policy and \
-The Low Water-Mark Mandatory Access Control (LOMAC) policy.
